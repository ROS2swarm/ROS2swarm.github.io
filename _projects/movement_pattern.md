ROS2swarm provides the following basic movement patterns: 

* attraction: robots group (based on attractive potential field) 
* aggregation: robots group (FSM-based approach)
* drive: robots drive straight forward
* dispersion: robots distribute in space (based on a repulsive potential field)
* minimalist flocking: collective motion, implementation based on [Moeslinger et al.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21314-4_47)
* random walk: robots alternate between driving straight forward and turning
