ROS2swarm currently supports the following robot platforms in the Gazebo simulator and as physical robots: 

* TurtleBot 3 Burger and Waffle Pi 
* Jackal UGV (using the ROS bridge) 
* Thymio II 

We are currently working on including support for the TurtleBot 4 and other platforms. 

New platforms that provide range measurements (e.g., using a LiDAR or IR sensors) and that can be steered via a linear velocity along the x-axis and an angular velocity around the z-axis can be easily added.
